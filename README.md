---> PROJECT OVERVIEW :

This repository hosts a foundational machine learning project designed to introduce and reinforce the core concepts of supervised learning, specifically regression. The goal is to build a simple model that predicts house prices based on several key features. This project is ideal for beginners in machine learning who want to gain hands-on experience with a complete, end-to-end workflow.

---> OBJECTIVE :

>>The primary objective of this project is to:

1. Understand the Machine Learning Workflow: Go through the typical steps involved in a machine learning project, from data preparation to model evaluation.

2. Implement Linear Regression: Apply the Linear Regression algorithm, a fundamental regression model.

3. Evaluate Model Performance: Learn how to assess the effectiveness of a regression model using relevant metrics.

4. Gain Practical Experience: Translate theoretical knowledge of supervised learning into practical coding skills.

---> KEY CONCEPTS COVERED :

1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data (features and corresponding target values).

2. Regression: Predicting a continuous numerical output (house price).

3. Features (Independent Variables): Input variables used for prediction (e.g., Area_sqft, NumBedrooms).

4. Target (Dependent Variable): The variable we aim to predict (e.g., Price_USD).

5. Data Splitting: Dividing data into training and testing sets to evaluate generalization.

6. Model Training: The process where the algorithm learns patterns from the training data.

7. Prediction: Using the trained model to forecast values for new, unseen data.

8. Model Evaluation: Quantifying the model's accuracy and performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

9 .Model Interpretation: Understanding the coefficients and intercept of a linear regression model.

---> TECHNOLOGIES USED :

>>Python 3.x: The programming language.

>>Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

>>NumPy: For numerical operations.

>>Scikit-learn: The primary machine learning library for implementing Linear Regression, data splitting, and evaluation metrics.
